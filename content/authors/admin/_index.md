Freshwater biologist by education with interests in everything related to **data, water and computing**. Research interest in freshwater carbon cycling, especially greenhouse gas fluxes and large scale carbon budgets.

This webpage is my outlet for posts about cool data science stuff and ongoing/previous projects. Everything is very likely to have something to do with data and water!
