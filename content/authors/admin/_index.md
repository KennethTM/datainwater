Freshwater biologist by education with research interest in freshwater carbon cycling, especially greenhouse gas fluxes and large scale carbon budgets. Enthusiastic about everyting related to data analysis and programming. 

This webpage is an outlet for posts on data science and ongoing/previous projects. Everything is very likely to have something to do with **data and water**!
